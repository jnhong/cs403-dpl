! -------------- MAKEFILE COMMANDS -------------- !

All of the make commands specified by the programming assignment instructions are available:

 - error{1..5}{,x,p}
 - arrays{,x,p}
 - conditionals{,x,p}
 - recursion{,x,p}
 - iteration{,x,p}
 - functions{,x,p}
 - lambda{,x,p}
 - dictionary{,x,p}
 And as an extra, 
 - return{,x,p}

No suffix simply prints out the input .403 code.
Suffix 'x' executes the input .403 code.
Suffix 'p' processes the .403 code through the pretty printer.

For example,
    $ make lambda
will print the input .403 program.
    $ make lambdax
will execute the input .403 program.
    $ make lambdap
will pretty print the input .403 program.

The interpreter executable is named "403"; however, as required by the task description, an executable shell script named "dpl" is provided that simply executes "403" the given filename.
For example,
    $ dpl lambda.403
is equivalent to
    $ 403 lambda.403

Lastly,
    $ make clean
will remove object files and executables.
